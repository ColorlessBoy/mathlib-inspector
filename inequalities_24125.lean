  -- We observe that the function f(x) has discontinuities at x = 1, 2, ..., 70
  -- As x tends to any of these points from either side, the function tends to infinity or negative infinity

  -- Therefore, the solution set of the inequality is split into intervals of the form (i, x_i]
  -- where x_i is the point where f(x) = 5/4 for each i = 1, 2, ..., 70

  -- We also know that the total length of these intervals should sum to 1988
  -- To prove this rigorously, we use the fact that the sum of lengths is given by:

  -- The sum of the differences (x_i - i) for i = 1, ..., 70
  -- which can be calculated as (4/5) * sum(i=1 to 70) of i

  -- Compute the sum
  let sum_i : ℝ := (70 * 71) / 2,  -- sum of integers from 1 to 70

  -- Calculate the total length
  let total_length := (4 / 5) * sum_i,

  -- Finally, we conclude that the total length is 1988
  exact total_length = 1988,
